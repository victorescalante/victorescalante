### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Victor Escalante and this is a little bit about me ... 

I consider myself a self-taught person, I am currently studying to get the basic AWS certification, I like the topics related to load balancers, load and stress testing, horizontal growth of services, docker images and best practices, I am currently focused on AWS services even though I consider myself an agnostic person to cloud technologies.

I do personal projects, with new technologies, 50% of which are implemented in enterprise projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on @maxillc
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Terraform , AWS , DevOps and python best practice.
- IÂ´m Mexican :)
